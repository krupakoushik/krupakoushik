## Something about myself!
I wasnt specially good at academics but if it was anything related to computers, I was #1. I started learning python back in 2020 during lockdown just like many others but I wasnt that good back in the day *except for making discord bots* as I wasn't serious in life BUT fast-forward to 2021 I started taking life seriously and started getting good in academics and fast forward to 2023 as soon as I was done with high school, I had a lot of free time as it would take 2-3 months for universities/colleges to begin, and during this period I started learning web development and I got my first gig and thats when I decided to establish my own company named RoMaLax. My first project was a discord bot that I made using a tutorial from freecodecamp and back in the day, replit was my IDE...anyways I have been using vs code for a while now. I actually got my discord bots on top.gg and other websites but me back then deleted all those bots...but I have recently made a cool ass bot named Cynthia, you can check it out by joining my discord server. I am going to do CSE course in AI/ML in the coming 4 years and thats me!
